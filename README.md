# Private Beta 
<br>

## Vision
_South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE) is a new Agency that will **launch on 1st April.**_
_This page is about the design of a corporate website to raise awareness of SOSE and support the Agencyâ€™s objectives._
_The new corporate website will supplement [**Find Business Support**](https://www.findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/) (FBS), existing partner websites and other Scottish websites._


## Notes
- Discovery phase in October- December 2019
- There was **no Alpha phase**. We started directly on a private Beta phase in January 2020.
- There is an interim partnership: the **South of Scotland Economic Partnership (SoSEP)** [with a live website](https://www.sosep.co.uk/site/index.php)
