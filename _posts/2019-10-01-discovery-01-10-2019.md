### Desk research

- [South of Scotland Enterprise Agency Consultation Analysis Report](../files/SoSEnterprise-Agency-consultation-analysis.pdf), 2018 (PDF)
- [HIE - Website Analytics Review](../files/HIE-WebsiteAnalyticsReview.pdf) (PDF)

### 2 workshops
Two workshops were conducted in the South of Scotland in: 

– Hawick (Scottish Borders)
- Dumfries (Dumfries and Galloway)

Each workshop was attended by 10 individuals (total = 20) representing organisations that have an office in the South of Scotland, and each related to a different type of organization. 

The Hawick workshop focused on prospective start-ups and early start-ups, while the Dumfries one focused on established organisations. 

The needs of these groups, in terms of the type of support they might look for, and benefit from, are very different – so it was important to address them separately.
