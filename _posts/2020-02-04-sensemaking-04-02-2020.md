### What we did
- Sense making session for the team to get a shared understanding of the 7 user research sessions done the previous week
- Recruit customers for further testing sessions with a focus on customers in the Third sector and Community organisations
- Follow up interviews with some key people from SoSEP and the councils to get a better understanding of the community organisations needs and expectations
- More Card sorting testing for the Information Architechture (IA)
- Gathered analytics of the [**SoSEP website**](https://www.sosep.co.uk/info/7/south-scotland-enterprise) for the period covering Nov 2019 Jan 2020
- Looked at previous personas done for [Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE)](https://www.hie.co.uk/), and a Scottish Enterprise (SE) corporate website for potential reuse


### Why
- The research done the previous week highlighted that the Community aspects were really important in the South of Scotland area and we needed more data
- Highland and Islands Enterprise (HIE) has a similar focus on Community compared to the rest of Scotland, so some of their personas can be reused

### Summary of insights from Sprint 1 research
- Be clear about what the new agency will do and will not do
- How will SoSE be different â€“ what is our pitch
- Align with expectations that have been set to date - companies are expecting something different and better 
- Capitalise on what does work well
- Look at where influence lies (especially within social enterprise and communities)
- Focusing on right things will be a gamechanger for the region
- Councils big influence but spread too thinly across region
- 1-1 relationships important and take time to build
- Make better use of use of assets (e.g., ageing population not seen as problem but a centre of excellence for dementia, etc)


### Documents

- IA and card sorting results (will be added soon)
- [SoSEP analytics](../files/sosep-website-analytics-Nov19-Jan20.pdf) (PDF)
- Personas (coming soon)
