## What we did
- Sense making session for the team to get a shared understanding of the 7 user research sessions the previous week
- Recruit customers for further testing sessions with a focus on customers in the Third sector and Community organisations
- Follow up interviews with some key people from SoSEP and the councils to get a better understanding of the community organisations needs and expectations
- more card sorting testing for the IA
- Gathered analytics of the SoSEP website for Nov 2019 Jan 2020
- Looked at previous personas done for Highland and Islands Enterprise (HIE), and Scottish Enterprise (SE) corporate website for potential reuse


## Why
- The research done the previous week highlighted that the Community aspect was really important in the South of Scotland area and we needed more data
- HIE has a similar focus on Community compared to the rest of Scotland, so some of their personas can be reused

## Documents
Coming soon: 
- Sense making and research highlights
- IA and card sorting results
