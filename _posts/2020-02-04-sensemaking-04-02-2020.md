## What we did
- sense making session for the team to get a shared understanding of the 7 user research session the previous week
- recruit customers for further testing session with a focus on customers in the Third sector and Community organisation
- follow up interviews with some key people from SoSEP et council to get a better understanding of the community organisation needs and expectations
- more card sorting testing for the IA
- gathered analytics of the SoSEP website for Nov 2019 Jan 2020
- looked at previous personas done for Highland and Islands Enterprise (HIE), and Scottish Enterprise (SE) corporate website for potential reuse


## Why
- The research done the previous week highlighted that the Community organisation was really important in this South of Scotland and we needed more data
- HIE has a similar focus on Community compared to the rest of Scotland, so some of their persona can be reused

## Documents
Coming soon: 
- Sense making and research highlights
