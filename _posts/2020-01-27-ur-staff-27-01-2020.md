### What we did

**General research with account managers and members of SoSEP** (F2F and Skype sessions) to assess:
- specificities of the South of Scotland area 
- the role of various communities in the area and how they interact with businesses
- customer and stakeholder needs and pain points
- expectations of how SoSE can address gaps and opportunities
- website needs


We also did some **Card sorting online for the Information Architecture (IA)**

### Why
- Complement the research done during the discovery phase
- Making sure the specific needs of the customers and staff in this region drive the design of the website
- Making sure the (IA) make sense for the users
- Capture the needs and reflect them in our personas

### Summary of findings
- Be clear about what the new agency will do and will not do
- How will SoSE be different – what is our pitch?
- Align with expectations that have been set to date - companies are expecting something different and better 
- Capitalise on what does work well
- Look at where influence lies (especially within social enterprise and communities)
- Focusing on right things will be a gamechanger for the region
- Councils big influence but spread too thinly across region
- 1-1 relationships important and take time to build
- More focus on nurturing key skill-sets for region (opportunity for joined up working with schools, colleges, industry and careers advice)
- Make better use of use of assets (e.g., ageing population not seen as problem but a centre of excellence for dementia, etc)
